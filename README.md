# LeetCode Auto Practice + GitHub Pusher

This project runs on a Raspberry Pi and on exactly 4 random days each ISO week generates a LeetCode-style solution using a local Ollama LLM, validates it, writes files, and pushes to the configured Git repo.

Usage
- Edit `.env` from `.env.example` to tune settings.
- Place problems in `data/questions.txt` (blocks separated by a line with `---`).
- Bootstrap the environment using `scripts/bootstrap.sh`.
- Start Ollama locally and ensure it's reachable at `http://127.0.0.1:11434`.
- Run a dry-run: `LCB_RUN_MODE=dry-run python -m leetcode_bot.run`.

Safety / Transparency
- Solutions are generated by a local LLM and validated with a lightweight syntax check. They are LLM-assisted, not authoritative.
- This project does not scrape LeetCode or access external problem pages.

Troubleshooting
- If Ollama is not reachable, start it and verify `/api/tags`.
- If pushes fail, ensure SSH keys and remote origin are configured.
